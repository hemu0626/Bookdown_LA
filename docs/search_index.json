In this module, we will introduce fundamental tools and basic theories for treating the linearity of many variables and crunching collections of numbers (data). Roughly speaking, we will study vector geometry not only in the plane or space but also in n dimensional space. (Imagine that your ratings of 100 movies put you as a vector in 100-dimensional space. Would you and five of your friends be actually sitting on a two dimensional plane contained in the 100-dimensional space?) This module would be useful for future studies in mathematics and other disciplines, for example, statistics, finance, engineering, computer science, physics, economics and so on. Linear algebra also helps students to understand abstract concepts in group theory and quantum mechanics. This course starts with solution of systems of linear equations, we will discuss matrix theory, vector space, and matrix spectral theory and inner product space. Together with the theory, we will introduce some case studies that aim to apply the techniques in linear algebra for solving real world problems. 1.1 Textbook Mandatory textbook: Lay, Lay &amp; McDonald, Linear Algebra and its applications, Pearson.
