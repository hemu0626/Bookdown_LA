A system of linear equations is called linear system. 1.1.2 Solution of a linear system A system of linear equations has The set of all possible solution is called solution set . Linear systems with the same solution set are called equivalent. A system of linear equations is said to be consistent if it has either one solution or infinitely many solutions A system is inconsistent if it has no solution. 1.1.3 Matrix Notation Suppose we have a linear system: \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{aligned} &amp;x_1-2x_2+x_3=0\\\\ &amp;2x_2-8x_3=8\\\\ &amp;5x_1-5x_3=10 \\end{aligned} \\end{equation}\\] Here, we introduce two forms to represent a linear system using matrix. 1.1.3.1 Augmented Matrix Form \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{aligned} M= \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 2 &amp; -8 &amp; 8\\\\ 5 &amp; 0 &amp; -5 &amp; 10 \\end{bmatrix}\\\\ %&amp;\\xrightarrow[R_1-5R_3]{R_2+2R_3} \\end{aligned} \\end{equation}\\] 1.1.3.2 Coefficient Matrix Form Denote \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{aligned} A= \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 1 \\\\ 0 &amp; 2 &amp; -8 \\\\ 5 &amp; 0 &amp; -5 \\end{bmatrix} \\qquad X=\\begin{bmatrix} x_1\\\\ x_2\\\\x_3 \\end{bmatrix} \\qquad B=\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 8 \\\\ 10 \\end{bmatrix} \\qquad \\iff \\quad AX=B \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\end{equation}\\] 1.1.3.3 Matrix Elements \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{aligned} &amp;M= \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 2 &amp; -8 &amp; 8\\\\ 5 &amp; 0 &amp; -5 &amp; 10 \\end{bmatrix}\\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad M= \\begin{bmatrix} m_{11} &amp; m_{12} &amp; m_{13} &amp; m_{14}\\\\ m_{21} &amp; m_{22} &amp; m_{23} &amp; m_{24}\\\\ m_{31} &amp; m_{32} &amp; m_{33} &amp; m_{34} \\end{bmatrix}\\\\\\\\ &amp; \\text{$M$ is a 3 $\\times$ 4 matrix (3 rows, 4 columns)} %&amp;\\xrightarrow[R_1-5R_3]{R_2+2R_3} \\end{aligned} \\end{equation}\\] The form of \\(AX=B\\) is based on the matrix multiplication, which we are going further in next chapter. 1.1.4 Elementary Row Operations (Replacement, ) Replace one row by the sum of itself and a multiple of another row. (Interchange, ) Interchange two rows. (Scaling, ) Multiply all entries in a row by a nonzero constant. Two matrices are called row equivalent if there is a sequence of elementary row operations that transforms one matrix into the other. It is important to note that row operations are reversible. If the augmented matrices of two linear systems are row equivalent, then the two systems have the same solution set. 1.1.5 Existence and Uniqueness of Solutions Two fundamental questions about a linear system are as follows: Is the system consistent; that is, does at least one solution exist? If a solution exists, is it the only one; that is, is the solution unique? 1.2 Row Reduction and Echelon Form 1.2.1 Leading Entry and Pivot Position \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{bmatrix} {1} &amp; -2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; {2} &amp; -8 &amp; 8\\\\ {5} &amp; 0 &amp; -5 &amp; 10\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\\\ \\end{equation}\\] A of a row refers to the leftmost nonzero entry (in a nonzero row).\\ Theorem 1.1 This is a theorem environment that can contain any Markdown syntax.
